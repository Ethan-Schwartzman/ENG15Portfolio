        <h1>Four Year Plan</h1>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Freshman Year</h2>
        <p class="info">The focus for my first year is mostly to finish the prerequisites for my upper-division CSE classes so I can start taking
          them as soon as possible. I am also doing my Marshall writing classes (DOC) and a few other GEs. In Spring, I am also taking MUS
          5 which is a requirement for the ICAM music minor. During this year I want to join student orgs for computer science such as ACM.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Sophomore Year</h2>
        <p class="info">In Sophomore year I plan to comple almost all of the rest of my GEs. In Fall I am taking a lot of upper-division CSE classes that are
          prerequisites for more advanced classes like CSE 101, 103, and 110. I also have classes that work towards my minor in every
          quarter (VIS and MUS). I also plan on applying for research opportunities since it will help me gain experience and will be
          a good addition to my resume.
        </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Junior Year</h2>
        <p class="info">This year I finish my last GE in Fall. By the end of the year I will have completed all the
          requirements for the ICAM minor. For the rest of my classes I am taking CSE electives. I need 15 in total and
          at least 3 from each of the three categories. It would also be helpful to look for internships this year. I'll
          definetly apply to Qualcomm since it is a local company and aligns with what I want to learn and the kind of 
          career I want to pursue.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/year3.png" alt="Year 3" class="center">

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Senior Year</h2>
        <p class="info">
          For my last year, I will finish the rest of the CSE electives. If I take three classes and a lab
          for the first two quarters, I can graduate a quarter early. After this I want to consider another year at
          UCSD where I could obtain a Master's Degree, or I could also begin work if a job opportunity arises.
