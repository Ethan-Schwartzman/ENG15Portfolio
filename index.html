        <h1>Hi, I'm Ethan</h1>
        <p class="info">Welcome to my web porfolio for ENG15. 
            I'm Ethan Schwartzman, a computer science major at UCSD.
            I can't wait to learn and develop many lifelong skills in the coming years! 
            I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities!

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Defining Success</h2>
        <p class="info">To me, success means not only doing well academically, but also in my professional and personal
            spheres as well. It means staying healthy both physically and mentally. To succeed I aim to be
            happy, motivated, and constantly learning!
        </p>

        <h2 class="letter">Long Term Goal</h2>
        <p class="info">My long term goal is to obtain a bachelor's degree in computer science in four years or less.
          Getting my degree will open many doors and job opportunities.
        </p>
        <h2 class="letter">Short Term Goal</h2>
        <p class="info">One short term goal I have is to join at least two student organizations in the upcoming fall quarter.
          This will allow me to become involved in the community and be social and make friends along the way.
        </p>
        <h2 class="letter">Short Term Goal</h2>
        <p class="info">Another short term goal I have is to try get good sleep during the SEI program, at least 8 hours a night.
          This will help me to perform better in my 8am classes and will generally improve my mood and focus.
